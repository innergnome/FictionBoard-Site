# Markup in FictionBoard

The easiest way to create content and handle data in FictionBoard is to write [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as its primary data carrier. This allows you as a user to work directly in the data layer using the editor of your choice and import/export content as it pleases you. 

## RPG Markdown, our data format

To allow FictionBoard to better understand what is data and what is content we suggest you followed the guidelines set out in [RPG Markdown](https://github.com/innergnome/rpg-markdown).

## Writing content with non-Markdown editors

If you are uncomfortable writing Markdown you could write in Word, Google Docs or similar but with a limited set of formating. The less formatting the more likely it is that FictionBoard can import and export your content. [RPG Markup](https://github.com/innergnome/rpg-markup) contains guidelines for how to structure your content for best results in FictionBoard.
